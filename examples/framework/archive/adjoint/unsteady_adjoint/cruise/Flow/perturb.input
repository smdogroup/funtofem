3  = Shape
4  = x-rotation rate
5  = y-rotation rate
6  = z-rotation rate
7  = Grid point x
8  = Grid point y
9  = Grid point z
11 = truncation error
12 = first rcs jet plenum p0
13 = first rcs jet plenum t0
100+ = add an imaginary source term to equation PERTURB-100 of node GRIDPOINT
         (to verify the adjoint lambda value)
