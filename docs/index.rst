   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least

Welcome to FUNtoFEM's Documentation
===================================

If you are using FUNtoFEM with existing interface class and solvers, you should only need the :doc:`model` and :doc:`driver`.
If you wish to create a new interface or a new driver, see the :doc:`programmers_guide`.
